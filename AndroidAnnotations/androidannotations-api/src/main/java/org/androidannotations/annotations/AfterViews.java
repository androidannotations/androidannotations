 * Methods annotated with @{@link AfterViews} will be called after
 * {@link Activity#setContentView(int)} is called by the generated activity.
 * <p/>
 * This occurs AFTER <code>setContentView(View)</code> which is called at the
 * end of super.onCreate(). Any view depending code should be done in an
 * {@link AfterViews} annotated method.
 * <p/>
 * The method MUST have zero parameters.
 * <p/>
 * There MAY be several methods annotated with @{@link AfterViews} in the same
 * activity.

 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;EActivity(R.layout.main)
 * public class MyActivityTwo extends Activity {
 * 
 * 	&#064;ViewById
 * 	TextView myTextView;
