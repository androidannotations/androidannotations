/**
 * Should be used on {@link android.app.Application} classes to enable usage of
 * AndroidAnnotations.
 * <p/>
 * Your code related to injected beans should go in an {@link AfterInject}
 * annotated method.
 * <p/>
 * If the class is abstract, the enhanced application will not be generated.
 * Otherwise, it will be generated as a final class. You can use
 * AndroidAnnotations to create Abstract classes that handle common code.
 * <p/>
 * Most annotations are supported in {@link EApplication} classes, except the
 * ones related to views and extras.
 * <p/>
 * The enhanced application can also be injected in any enhanced class by using
 * {@link App} annotation.
 * <p/>
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * Example :
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;EApplication
 * public class MyApplication extends Application {
 * 
 * 	&#064;Bean
 * 	MyBean myBean;
 * 
 * 	&#064;AfterInject
 * 	void init() {
 * 		myBean.doSomeStuff();
 * 	}
 * }
 * 
 * &#064;EBean
 * public class MyBean {
 * 
 * 	&#064;App
 * 	MyApplication myApp;
 * }
