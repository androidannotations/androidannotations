/**
 * Should be used on custom classes to enable usage of AndroidAnnotations.
 * <p/>
 * This class MUST have either a default constructor (ie without parameters) or
 * a constructor with only a parameter of type {@link android.app.Context}.
 * <p/>
 * Your code related to injected beans should go in an {@link AfterInject}
 * annotated method.
 * <p/>
 * If the class is abstract, the enhanced bean will not be generated. Otherwise,
 * it will be generated as a final class. You can use AndroidAnnotations to
 * create Abstract classes that handle common code.
 * <p/>
 * Most annotations are supported in {@link EBean} classes, except the ones
 * related to extras. Views related annotations will only work if the bean was
 * injected in an activity with a layout containing the views you're dealing
 * with. If your bean needs a {@link android.app.Context} you can inject on by
 * using an {@link RootContext} annotated field.
 * <p/>
 * Beans have two possible scopes : default or singleton. Default scope should
 * be preferred but in some case it may be useful to use a singleton scope
 * (mainly if you want to keep some runtime state in your bean).
 * <p/>
 * The enhanced bean can also be injected in any enhanced class by using
 * {@link Bean} annotation.
 * <p/>
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * Example :
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;EBean
 * public class MyBean {
 * 
 * 	&#064;RootContext
 * 	Context context;
 * 	&#064;Bean
 * 	MySingletonBean mySingletonBean;
 * 
 * 	&#064;AfterInject
 * 	void init() {
 * 		mySingletonBean.doSomeStuff(context);
 * 	}
 * }
 * 
 * &#064;EBean(scope = Scope.Singleton)
 * public class MySingletonBean {
 * 
 * 	public void doSomeStuff(Context context) {
 * 		// ...
 * 	}
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
