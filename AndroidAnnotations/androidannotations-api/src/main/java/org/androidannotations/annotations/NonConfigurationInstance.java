/**
 * Use on activity fields to retain instances that are intensive to
 * compute, on configuration changes.
 * 
 * See <a href=
 * "http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes.html#RetainingAnObject"
 * >RetainingAnObject</a> in the Android Documentation.<br />
 * <br />
 * Caution: While you can annotate any field, you should never annotate a field
 * that is tied to the Activity, such as a Drawable, an Adapter, a View or any
 * other object that's associated with a Context. If you do, it will leak all
 * the views and resources of the original activity instance. (Leaking resources
 * means that your application maintains a hold on them and they cannot be
 * garbage-collected, so lots of memory can be lost.)<br />
 * <br />
 * This caution doesn't apply to beans annotated with {@link Bean}, because
 * AndroidAnnotations automatically takes care of rebinding their context.
