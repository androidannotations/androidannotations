/**
 * Should be used on Activity classes to enable usage of AndroidAnnotations
 * 
 * Any view related code should happen in an {@link AfterViews} annotated
 * method.
 * 
 * The annotation value should be one of R.layout.* fields. If not set, no
 * content view will be set, and you should call the setContentView() method
 * yourself, in <b>onCreate()</b>
 * 
 * If the activity is abstract, the generated activity will not be final.
 * Otherwise, it will be final. You can use AndroidAnnotations to create
 * Abstract classes that handle common code, but we want you to make a clear
 * decision on that subject.
 * 
 * The main reason is that the generated code should not be considered a public
 * API, and may change between releases. So if you extend some generated
 * activity, you may have to adapt your code when you upgrade
 * AndroidAnnotations.
